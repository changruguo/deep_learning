    "## describes of the numpy broadcasting\n",
    "1、the term broadcasting describes how Numpy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations.\n",
    "2、subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is \"broadcast\" across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes.\n",
    "3、Broadcasting provides a mean of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python.\n",
    "4、it does this without making needless copies of the data and usually leads to efficiency algorithm implementations.\n",
    "5、there are,however, cases where broadcasting is a bad idea because it leads to inefficient use of memory that slows computation.\n"

    "## General Broadcasting Rules\n",
    "1、when operating on two arrays, Numpy compares their shapes element-wise.\n",
    "2、it starts with the trailing(i.e. rightmost) dimensions and works its way left. Two dimensions are compatible when：\n",
    "* they are equal, or\n",
    "* one of them is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "3、if these conditions are met,a 'ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together' exception is thrown, indicating that the array have incompatible shapes.\n",
    "4、the size of the resulting array is the size that is not 1 along each axis of the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5、arrays do not need to have the same number of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6、For example, if you have a 256x256x3 array of RGB values, and you want to scale each color in the image by a different value,you can multiply the image by a one-dimensional array with 3 values. Lining up the sizes of the trailing axes of these arrays according to the broadcast rules, shows that they are compatible.\n",
    "![](image/img_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "7、when either of the dimensions compared is one, the other is used.In other words,dimensions with size 1 are stretched or 'copied' to match the other.\n",
    "8、in the following example, both A and B always have axes with length 1 that are expanded to larger size during the broadcast operation.\n",

    "* b acts like a(5,6) where b[0,:] is broadcast to the other rows.\n",
